Summary:
This repository contains a write-up documenting the completion of the Net Sec Challenge from TryHackMe’s Network Security module. 
The challenge focuses on practical network security fundamentals, service discovery, and basic authentication attacks, using commonly used security tools in controlled lab environments.

Key Takeaways:
- Practical use of Nmap for port scanning, service detection, and script-based enumeration
- Practical use of Hydra to perform brute-force password attacks against poorly protected accounts with weak credentials
- Understanding how misconfigured or weak authentication mechanisms can lead to unauthorized access
- Improved ability to interpret scan results and make informed next-step decisions during assessments

Tools Used:
- Nmap
- Hydra
- TryHackMe AttackBox
