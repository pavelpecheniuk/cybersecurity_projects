Summary: 
This work analyzes Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) trends observed in the first half of the year 2025 (from 01.01 to 30.06) using data from the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog. 
The report identifies and interprets the most common Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs), with a primary focus on the vulnerabilities most relevant to the fictional fintech startup - Fin Analytics, the object of another project dedicated to risk assessment. 
The project also proposes detailed technical and organizational mitigation strategies for hardening Fin Analytics’ security posture.

Key Deliverables:
- Vulnerability data analysis (exploration of CISA KEV, CVSS-related sources, MITRE, OWASP).
- Overview of existing sources of threat relevant to the company.
- Concrete and detailed mitigation strategies for each high-risk CWE.

Skills Gained:
- Vulnerability Analysis;
- Threat Hunting (application of CWE, MITRE, OWASP and CVSS-related frameworks);
- Technical reporting and business-oriented communication;
- Working knowledge of Microsoft Excel.
