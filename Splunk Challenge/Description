This write-up documents completion of the room Investigating with Splunk by TryHackMe.
The main task is to investigate logs from infected Windows machines to identify anomalous behaviour with the help of the well-known popular SIEM tool Splunk.
The main objective is to demonstrate my exposure to Splunk and log analysis skills for efficient threat detection and response, as well as the Windows security monitoring knowledge.
