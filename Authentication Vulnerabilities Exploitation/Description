This repository contains the write-up documenting completion of the labs dedicated to authentication vulnerabilities and their exploitation.
The labs are provided by PortSwigger: Web Security Academy.
By completing these labs I've expanded my knowledge of web authentication mechanisms and their vulnerability, practiced my exploitation skills and enhanced my mastery of Burp Suite.
